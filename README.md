Prompt text from: https://thepracticetest.com/typing/tests/practice-paragraphs/

To calculate the net and gross WPM along with accuracy, I used the following resource. Although the outputted results look good, forumalas can be tweeked in code to modify the test's results.

WPM and accuracy formulas from:  https://www.typingtyping.com/wpm-calculator/
